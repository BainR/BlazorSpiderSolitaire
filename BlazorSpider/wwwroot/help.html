    <h3>Blazor Spider Solitaire - Help</h3>

                There are several implementations of Spider Solitaire with slightly different rules.  This implementation is most closely patterned on the version by AisleRiot.

                The purpose of this application was to help the author become familiar with the Blazor framework.  It is being shared in hopes that others may benefit from lessons learned.  The game has issues known to the author.  The top two are the lack of a reasonable drag image and the lack of support for touch screens.  It is hoped these features will be better supported in future versions of Blazor.
